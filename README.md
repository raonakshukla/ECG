# ECG
Predict cases of Cardiomyopathy and Myocardial Infarction

For ECG, the goal was to predict the cardiac condition of the maximum patients accurately. A machine learning based approach in this domain can offer a low-cost tool for preventive diagnosis of cardiac disease and extend healthcare to underprivileged groups. The project tests various pre-processing and feature engineering techniques to extract the maximum information from ECG signals. The performance of multiple classification models is evaluated to get the best accuracy score of 72% on the test set. Finally, the report also attempts to make the results more explainable by analyzing the feature importance and aligning it with the literature.
